# Experiment 2

Adaptive Lab Evolution Experimental Application

Science leads: Nidhi Gupta, Paul Hanke, Chris Henry
Robotics lead: Casey Stone

## Experiment Abstract

This project combines AI hypothesis generation with high-throughput experimental biology to accelerate rational microbial engineering. AI is used to design gene variants for vanillate/vertarate demethylase enzymes in Acinetobacter baylyi. These designs are then tested using automated lab systems and evolving bacterial cultures. Experimental results are fed back into AI models for iterative refinement.

## General Application Description

In this experimental application, two separate adaptive lab evolution experiments will run simultaneously.
